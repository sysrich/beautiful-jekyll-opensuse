Hello! I'm Richard. This is my blog to comment about stuff related to my contributions to the <a title="openSUSE" href="http://www.openSUSE.org">openSUSE project</a> and my work for <a href="http://www.suse.com">SUSE Linux</a>

I've used SUSE/openSUSE since 2003, finding myself helping out more and more as time went on.

In 2013 I joined SUSE to work as a QA Engineer.  
I am currently the QA Technical Lead for [openQA](http://openqa.opensuse.org)  
2014 saw me becoming the Chairman of the openSUSE Project.

I've done most work with openSUSE's <a title="openSUSE GNOME" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:GNOME">GNOME</a>, <a title="openSUSE Marketing" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Marketing">Marketing</a>, and <a title="openSUSE Artwork" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Artwork">Artwork</a> teams, and generally causing trouble by trying to fix things wherever I think I can.

I also spend a lot of time in <a title="openSUSE IRC Channels" href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:IRC_list">openSUSE's IRC channels</a> on irc.freenode.org under the name sysrich (formerly ilmehtar)
